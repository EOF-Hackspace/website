**EOF** is a new community workshop serving the Oxford area.  Although we are still in the very early stages of development we can already offer a space for electronics work, 3D Printing, and Laser etching.

We plan on expanding our offering based on what our members' interests.

## How we operate

*(Describe co-op, member-run nature)*

## Facilities

*(Explain how hackspaces tend to have a DIY/self-service mentality.)*

We currently offer the following tools:

* X
* Y
* Z

Workloads we're aiming to support in the near future:

* Basic Wood Work
* Advanced Interferometry
* Jazz improvisation

*(These will need to be replaced with real items)*

*(Explanation that these workloads are decided by our members.  Link to [How to Join](/how-to-join/) page)*
