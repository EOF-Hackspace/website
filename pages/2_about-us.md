**EOF** is a new community workshop serving the Oxford area.

Although we are still in the very early stages of development we can already offer a space for electronics work, 3D Printing, and Laser etching.

The tools we purchase and the direction in which we expand will be primarily decided by our members.  If you would like us to acquire a particular tool, please join the co-op and make your case!

We also take suggestions from non-member users, however it may take longer to action them. 

## How we operate

*(Describe co-op, member-run nature)*

## Facilities

*(Explain how hackspaces tend to have a DIY/self-service mentality.)*

We currently offer the following tools:

* X
* Y
* Z

Workloads we're aiming to support in the near future:

* Basic Wood Work
* Advanced Interferometry
* Jazz improvisation

*(These will need to be replaced with real items)*

*(Explanation that these workloads are decided by our members.  Link to [How to Join](/how-to-join/) page)*
